<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [Blender](https://blender.org/)
* [Python](https://python.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

At a minimum, you must install a version of Blender >= 2.80. Some advanced processing steps will require additional packages, as listed below. A full list of requirements can be found in the `requirements.txt`  file

Individual packages can be installed separately:

* scikit image: Image processing in Python
  ```sh
  pip install scikit-image
  ```
 * Pillow: Image processing in Python
    ```sh
    pip install pillow
    ```

Or the entire list of dependencies can be installed at once:

```sh
pip install r- path/to/requirements.txt
```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Download a recent version of [Blender](https://blender.org)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Location your Blender installation, and navigate to Blender's Python installation. It should be found at MyDrive/Program Files/Blender Foundation/Blender/X.X/python/bin

4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
